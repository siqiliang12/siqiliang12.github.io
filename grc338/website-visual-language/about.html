          <p>Welcome to Matcha & Moka, where the essence of Asian tradition blends seamlessly with the modernity of today's coffee culture. Founded by a passionate duo, Jane and Akiro, who shared a vision of creating a unique space where people could gather, relax, and enjoy the best of both worlds. Jane, with her roots in the bustling cities of Japan, brought the delicate art of Matcha making, while Akiro, a third-generation coffee grower from the highlands of Vietnam, introduced rich, aromatic coffee experiences.</p>
          <p>At Matcha & Moka, every sip tells a story. Our menu is a reflection of our heritage and passion for quality. From our signature Matcha Latte, whisked to perfection, to our robust Moka coffee, brewed from the finest beans, our offerings are a tribute to the flavors and rituals that have shaped us.</p>
          <p>We believe in sustainability and the power of community. This is why we source our tea leaves and coffee beans from family-owned farms that practice traditional, sustainable farming. It’s our way of giving back to the communities that have given us so much.</p>
